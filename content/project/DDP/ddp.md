The project intends to identify the barriers to using law in doing business experienced by Polish small and medium enterprises. The research will provide a diagnosis of justiciable problems experienced by SMEs, patterns of their resolution, and explain why SMEs do not use the law in all circumstances where this is feasible. The project will therefore have both an exploratory and explanatory aspect.
