abstract = "The existing regulations of labour and capital in Poland disproportionately burden weaker actors on the market. This is mainly due to Polandâ€™s dependent market economy model, with its competitive advantage based on low labour cost, flexible adjustment to variable demand, and an institutional environment that facilitates foreign investment. The high share of non-standard employment contracts and the lack of stability have stronger negative impact on those in the lower reaches of the labour market:"
