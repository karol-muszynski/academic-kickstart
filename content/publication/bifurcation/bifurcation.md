# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The article aims at depicting the idea of the bifurcation of working time and at verifying the possibility of its application to an emerging economy country such as Poland. The paper puts the bifurcation idea, the applicability of which was verified with regards to highly cognitive countries, in a wider context of the post-Fordist shift in capitalism. Empirical data confirms that the bifurcation has not occurred in Poland, but the analysis of the working time in different sectors gives some indication that the trends may be similar."
