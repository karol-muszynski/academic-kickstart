# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The paper examines factors which shaped the reform of the Polish labor law between 2009 and 2013. The government aimed at making legislation more flexible but its response: 1) was loosely related to the post-crisis issues in the Polish economy and overlapped with the program of the ruling party, abstract from the crisis itself; 2) revealed the features of the â€˜path-dependenceâ€™ mechanism, and in particular highlighted such comparative advantages of the Polish economy as low labor costs and the ability to variably adapt employment levels to employersâ€™ needs. The paper uses research tools of institutional approaches in political and social sciences, including the thinking on the varieties of capitalism, as well as the literature dealing with the retrenchment of welfare state."
